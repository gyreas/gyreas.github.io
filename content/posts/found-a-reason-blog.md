My [First](https://gyreas.github.io/posts/2024/11/first/) post was made so long ago, with the aim that this site won't be so barren. But it was really because I couldn't come up with a purpose for it.
My reason to blog.

I've been trying to learn alot of things far before I even had the idea of starting my own blogsite, and one problem for that is how to catalog what I learn so that revising or relearning won't be as hard as the first time.

Another is how to actually track my progress. Maybe my self-management is really lacking (probably is), but I still can't tell how much (or, whether or not) I've improved since my second year of college. (I'm in my 4th year now).

One (important) metric I use to guage my improvement is how easily I can deliver an impromptu lecture/class to my peers without breaking a sweat, and without bullshit. NO. I don't feel confident in anything.

Now, for what I aim to do this blogsite, just this: archive my learnings, my views on whatever stuff, things I'm hacking on, and a reminder to the my past self and future self that I've come so far.

Have fun!
